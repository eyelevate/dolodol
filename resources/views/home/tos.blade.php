    <p class="mb-1">


When you add an item to your shopping bag, you may either continue shopping or proceed to the checkout. If you are not logged in when proceeding to the checkout, you will be prompted to do so. Checkout involves 4 simple steps: Billing, Shipping, Payment and Order Confirmation.

Once we have received your order, you will receive an email acknowledging the details of your order. This email is not an order confirmation but rather recognition that we have received your requested order.

Please note that this does not guarantee the availability of the merchandise and that ALL ORDERS ARE SUBJECT TO AVAILABILITY. Although we make every effort to feature in stock pieces in our boutique, occasionally we may sell out of featured items. If we are unable to complete your order, you will be notified via email within 5 business days and will not be charged for orders that cannot be fulfilled.

ONCE AN ORDER HAS BEEN PLACED, WE ARE NOT ABLE TO MODIFY OR CANCEL YOUR ORDER. We reserve the right to decline your order in the event that we are unable to obtain authorization for payment, there are shipping restrictions for a particular item, or we do not have the item in stock.

Items in your shopping bag are not reserved and may be purchased by other clients. You may choose to register your email address to the waiting list for notification of arrival of a selected piece.

    </div>
    <p class="mb-1">
We offer repairs due to user wear, production fault, lost earring mates, or any other alteration to a piece of Freya's Fine Jewelry. We stand behind the quality of our merchandise and are happy to provide repairs due to breakage or damage free of charge for one year from the date of purchase on our online store. After one year, repairs may incur a charge. Elective repairs, such as ring resizing or chain lengthening, or errors by the customer typically involve a charge. They are repaired at the owner's expense plus the shipping charge.

 For elective repairs there is a $25 service charge plus the cost of additional materials and shipping.

 Half pairs of earrings cost half the price of a full pair of earrings plus shipping.

If an item needs to be repaired, please email us at info@FreyasFineJewelry.com for a return authorization number. Items cannot be accepted for a repair without an RA number. Please note that we are not responsible for your item until it is in our possession and that repairs typically require 4-6 weeks to complete.
